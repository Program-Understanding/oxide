    "ideal alphabet" which is being used as the standard yardstick to measure
    source alphabets. In information theory, two symbols are necessary and
    sufficient for an alphabet to be able to encode information, therefore
    the default is to let b = 2 ("binary entropy"). Thus, the entropy of the
    source alphabet, with its given empiric probability distribution, is a
    number equal to the number (possibly fractional) of symbols of the "ideal
    alphabet", with an optimal probability distribution, necessary to encode
    for each symbol of the source alphabet. Also note that "optimal probability
    distribution" here means a uniform distribution: a source alphabet with
    n symbols has the highest possible entropy (for an alphabet with n symbols)
    when the probability distribution of the alphabet is uniform. This optimal
    entropy turns out to be logb(n).
